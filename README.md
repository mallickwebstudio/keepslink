# Keeps Link

Keeps Link is a website where I've collected a list of super helpful websites for people who design or build websites, like UI/UX designers and developers.

## How It Works

*   Each website is shown as a **card** with:
    *   Name
    *   Short description
    *   Tags
    *   Link
    *   Picture
*   Users can explore the cards by:
    1.  Choosing a **category**
    2.  Selecting a **sub-category**
    3.  Viewing the **links**
*   Users can **bookmark** their favorite links.
*   There's also a **personal section** where users can:
    
    *   Save their own links
    *   Edit their saved links
    *   Delete their saved links
    
    **Note**: Personal links won’t have pictures since they are stored in the browser’s local storage.
